        "comment": "Hello, everyone!    here. Creator of the \"Linque's Boba Fett Tarkintown\" list that became super popular at the end of set 2. This time, I'm here to bring you a    list. This deck, in my opinion, is the true spiritual successor to Boba Fett Yellow and I'm going to explain to you why this deck is so strong. First of all, the deck is Double Yellow, so we have access to the most powerful event in the game: Cunning. And that's the big reason to use Jango Fett with the yellow base. The    is very simple: exhaust everything your opponent does, using Jango's ability and his events, while connecting power on the board. This deck is extremely strong against Aggro, abusing cunning and Elite P-38 Starfighter and Hold-Out Blaster that consistently exhaust your opponent's units. In addition, the deck has an early game power play, where on turn 2 you can play a Zuckuss or a Bossk, making your opponent have to deal with an absurd threat right from the start. About the rare base: it allows Jango to have the status of a Boba Fett (4/7), which is very strong. You will hardly miss the 4 fewer health, since the deck avoids a lot of damage from aggro decks. This deck unfortunately won't use ISB Agent, because for that I would need at least 14-16 events, and in this list I only use 11 and I don't intend to remove anything that the deck already has.  The deck is already extremely powerful against any aggro deck and has a very fair game against midrange decks, so we only need to worry about soft/hard control. 3x Bodhi Rook, Imperial Defector to remove events from your opponent's hand. You can remove 1 Toro and 2 Boba Unit in these mathups 3x TIE Phantom also against control, you can remove Elite P-38 Starfighter and replace it with TIE Phantom in these matchups, since the ability to exhaust is not that useful in matchups against these decks 2x TIE Advanced, to support the TIE Phantom plan in Space and try to win faster games against Control. You can remove 2x Evazan 2x Change of Heart, also against control, you can remove 2x No Good To Me Dead Well, that's the deck, I hope you like it. As always, I built this list with great care, thinking about the players who were orphaned by Boba Yellow after the ban. I personally hated facing Boba Yellow and I would hate facing Jango Yellow even more hahaha but still wanted to share this. "

        "comment": "Hey all, this is the decklist I have been using for Set 3 in my local showdowns, amongst friends and other events - it has had a extremely high winrate, being roughly 16-3 since I have started playing this specific list, not counting my dozen of win streaks versus friends and in casual settings. As always, this is a work in progress, so please keep that in mind - as the meta evolves, some cards may become worst than originally intended and need to be changed. I also understand that not everyone may have every card, so I'll do my best to help explain choices so that decent replacements can be found when needed. I will not be giving an explanation of every card - Palpatine Green has been relatively standard for some time now, and I feel it is well understood at least at its core why certain cards are present. I'll be happy to explain in more detail upon request, but I will mostly focus on the set 3 options included here for now, and the sideboard - with a bit at the end about options for other colors than mono-green. TLDR available after unit explanations.    The main reason I opted to stay into mono-green rather than other colors. This unit is phenomenal if you can drop it on turn 1. It helps cycle through needed early game units, and can guarantee a strong hand going into lategame. He shines the most versus aggro where I drop him on turn 1, play a sentinel turn 2, then use him to find another sentinel to drop right after, or a ship if needed. He is also an official, making him incredible with the Royal Guard.   A bit more tentative on him. Also an official, which is great. Theoritically, he helps generate infinite useless bodies to use with Palpatine ping for great card draw, without harming your board much. Realistically, this deck already has a lot of good targets for Palp ping, so I am unsure. He seems to be either incredible or horrible depending on the game. Feels a bit slow versus aggro, might be a good option to sideboard for the Gamorreans vs fast decks.   I mention V-Wing because there are a lot of other decent low cost ship options, but I feel as if the card draw for Palpatine outvalues any body early game.   One of the few options we have for early space that can actually kill 3HP ships without needing us to use additional sources of damage to deal with them. I used to play Star Vipers instead, but they felt much slower, when the only point of this slot is to survive early space aggro anyways, so forcing a sent feels a bit better.   A misunderstood card. This card is basically Power of the Darkside. If you control no units, you can still play it, as per the rule of (tldr) \"completing as much of a card as possible\". If you do control units, this card is great with Poggle, Superlaser, V-Wing, to just kill off a token unit for something bigger. A great addition to green decks, as we suffered greatly by not having any defeat cards. I wanted to play 3 copies of this, but in the lategame, Strike True can still be really good with large ships or Walkers and such, and so I decided to only play 2 and keep a Strike True. Realistically, could play 3 copies of this, it is excellent. Those are mostly I believe the more tech-choice cards for the maindeck. The rest is pretty standard. You can always swap out Return for Mauls or whatever but this is what I've enjoyed most. There's also the looming threat of a lot of Space Units right now with Jango's surge and Tarkin's comeback. Might need to add more Space Units to keep up eventually.    Main purpose here is to counter Han tbh, but it's also been a nice addition against the odd Hondo or decks with Tech in their list. I have been swapping out Poggle and another card I feel like for them.   An excellent card vs Aggro and even Midrange. Against exceptionally fast decks, such as Kylo, Grand Inquisitor, Sabine, etc, I swap out resupply for these. I rarely get to ramp for free anyways against those decks, and this card often can trade up. Also annoying to deal with later when you randomly drop one on turn 6. Alternatively, swap out Poggle for 2 of them in any matchup and it's probably good.   One of my more debatable choices. This exists purely for testing currently, I've put it in as a counter to Jango and Tarkin. It's done... Alright. Can delay Firespray quite well. But very uncertain about it though. I've been swapping out Crumb for this in those matchups, which is also questionable. Idk.   Just a good card. Can help stabilize the board super quickly, works with Palp's Return, obviously can be used with Crumb to not take damage. Feels weak vs Blue decks, but great against basically anything else. I've put him in in exchange for multiple cards, including Piett, Strike True, Poggle, Relentless, etc. I'm not sure what's best to swap him in for yet, but go with your feeling - with the mentality of slotting this card in because he can help you stabilize into endgame when dropped very quickly. So far, I believe he's best to slot in instead of Relentless against low-event decks.   Set 3 has given us significantly better early game card rotation and draw. Use the new cards to have a much stronger hand, giving a lot more options than before to stabilize with our first defeat a unit card, tons of tokens to use Palp on, and a card to search for exactly what we need. The main worry currently is the strength of Space decks, which needs to be monitored carefully. I believe we will be adding a lot more space units to sideboard as the meta progresses.  For me, Mono-Green remains the best. The additional card draw and cycling we've gotten has made it even better, and with modifications, I do believe this deck is easily top of A tier contender, could win big tournaments. Relies on a good knowledge of the meta however, which makes it hard to play this early into the set. 9/10, A tier deck. Yellow is quite strong, has been for a while. It offers significantly better stalling options to reach the lategame, but I've found it's also significantly worst against control matchups. The main positive argument I have for yellow is that it is EXTREMELY stronger in the Space Arena than Green is - this color might eventually become standard just to counter Jango. It is also very strong vs Aggro and Midrange. I've not found it particularly overall better, but it's still a very strong options. 8/10, A tier deck option. Red Palpatine is surprisingly good. Being able to play \"early\" Krayt Dragons can just instantly win you the game, it adds a good amount of removal through the help of Open Fire for example, with Sideboard of Bombing Run and such. Playing Palpatine (red unit) can swing boards, and it overall feels like the best option versus aggro specifically. It doesn't particularly fall off harder than the other colors in late game, and can even be teched into have some discard with Pillage and Throw and such which can feel really good situationally. A personal favorite of mine, so I am slightly biased. 8.5/10, A tier deck option. Blue Palpatine is my least favorite. It feels super boring, and the curve always feels off to me personally, as the main reason to play blue decks is to have access to the best control events in the game - however, focusing on controlling the board with events often makes you have a weak board yourself, and the blue variant doesn't feel like it has particularly better comeback options than the other colors, which is what Palpatine is all about - survive early, win late. It allows for a better ship, Childsen, better events, and potentially more healing with stuff such as the client, but... Meh. The color I recommend the least - it's still decent though. 7/10, B tier deck option. Hope this helps! If by a miracle someone sees this I'm more than happy to answer any questions. GL HF cuties."

Having the echo restored xp discard is great with obi. Good space units to help with restore. Pykesbane to help remove damaged units. Generals blade helps deploy zillo beast on 7. Really fun at store weekly play. Lmk feedback"

The turn 4 play of deploying   , having 4 units and then playing    will just win you the game from pressure alone sometimes. Use    to buff your leader    by discarding your unit    to make him really hard to deal with. I like to use    to bounce    back to my hand and then use him to buff something else.   and    are outstanding tools for trades and a lot of the times can be the thing you need to beat out other aggro decks like Green Sabine  and Leia Red."

        "comment": "This is the deck that made 4th place at FacetoFace Games Calgary 1K.\nShoutout to VeiledShot for 99% of the list, I made a few tweaks, then some tweaks back, and made a sideboard for it, and was able to luck into the best tiebreakers of the 3-2 records for top 4. After the event, here are my takeaways: The list is a blast to play, all of the top end feels incredible and it feels like we are playing the best options for the early game but that is where the deck can change the most with new sets. Everyone at the event was super nice, glad to have been a part of it! If you're ever in Prince George come check out my shop, 3 Goblins Games!"

        "comment": "Welcome to my take on the best way to utilize Obi Wan in all of his glory, with green, General's Blade, ECL, and a whole lot of big butts! The main gameplan of this deck is to utilize the General's Blade behind a wall of Sentinel units, cheating out your heavy hitters to crush your opponent! With the prevalence of Sabine and Jango on the rise, I feel like Obi Wan has a nice spot to be played in the meta! As a traditional midrange style deck, we have plenty of answers to Sabine decks, and aggro rush decks in general, in the form of big beefy sentinels, with some nice removal. With the addition of Jango to the scene, and the ability to ping damage and threaten removal with Tarkintown, our ability completely cancels it out by healing 1 damage, and paying nothing for it at all! Let me know what you all think of the deck, and if you are currently or have thought about running Obi Wan! May the force be wth you!"

But the deck works just fine without them. The turn 4 play of deploying Rex, having 4 units and then playing Cody will just win you the game from pressure alone sometimes. Use Echo, Restored to buff your leader Rex by discarding your unit Rex to make him really hard to deal with. I like to use Bright hope to bounce Echo back to my hand and then use him to buff something else. In defense of Kamino is crazy good value and Pyrrhic Assault is an outstanding tool for trades."

        "comment": "Asajj Red 5-0 Weekly Recap! This event recap is based off of my previous list, the list you're seeing  is my post event deck, with upgrades to shore up the weaknesses in this deck list! I go over my changes after the event recap! PreEvent - WW - Ahsoka Yellow: Got to the store a bit early and played a couple games against my friend and his Ahsoka Yellow deck, a deck that is very much so meant to be aggro with the Petranaki Arena. These were my first 2 games in with the deck after building it before heading out, and I was very surprised with how well it raced! On the Doorstep and TDR are AMAZING cards to play on T3 before flipping Asajj. Round 1 - W - Cad Bane Red: Long story short, the deck was way too slow to compete. They took on a more midrange ping units build, and not caring about trading out my own units for theirs, I ran head first into their base as they tried to keep up by slowly defeating my units. Flip turn I played Political Pressure, got 2 tokens, flipped Asajj, popped a Fallen Lightsaber on here, and swung in for 7, then 10 the following turn with Surprise Strike. Round 2 - W - Rey Yellow: This deck wanted to hunker down and try to outheal the damage dealt to it, with a slight emphasis on space to assumingly counter space race decks. Not being heavily contested on the ground allowed me to run rampant and win before Rey could even flip. Round 3 - W - Wat Red: Same Wat Red list from last week when I played my Dooku Blue list, sadly they more or less bricked their opening hand and mulligan, a couple space units were played but a surprising lack of ground trooper units put this deck very behind. Here are the changes I made from the previous list in order to get here! +3 Kylo's TIE Silencer\n+3 Lurking TIE Phantom\n-3 Greedo\n-3 Death Star Stormtrooper\n-2 Asajj Ventress\n-2 B1 Attack Platform These changes are to get a bit more deck weight into space, seeing as space race decks, specifically Jango Tarkintown, has seen a good bit of play recently, SCG Columbus for example. +3 Breaking In\n+3 Daring Raid\n-2 Force Throw These changes are to have more answers to sentinel units, both on ground and in space, as well as adding in some more damage, because we all know we want that! With the inclusion of Daring Raid, we have a few avenues to merit running Tarkintown as the base instead, but I'll leave that up to you!"

        "comment": "Check out the video for full description and strategy: https://youtu.be/GYuDlycFzmY The Mandalorian (Din Djarin) is an iconic character and this deck and leader capture the mandalorian creed and playstyle. A massive amount of upgrades offer a \"tall\" style of building up a few units for large swings of damage while providing the defense of exhausting your opponents units. The smuggle equipment (Jetpack and Hotshot) are a premium here as they work around the worst detriment to playing equipment: Your opponent 2 for 1'ing you. This deck is a more aggressive midrange style that aims to defeat the opponent by turn 6-7. Enfys Nest is the late game card Din needed to end the game, while Perilous Position keeps the mid-late game plays in check and lowers them into Mando's 4-6 HP exhaust threshold. Arm yourself to the teeth with this Mandalorian powerhouse and win the game with blasters and equipment."

        "comment": "Been working on another flavor of wat tambor, I’m pretty set on using him as my main leader for set 3! He comes out early has a huge body and you can hit some CRAZY numbers with any unit you have out. Here we have wat and his techno union army invading jedha city on his quest for the sacred eye of the albino cyclops… early on I played with petranaki arena but I wasn’t really finding a bigger wat as worth as jedha city. With jedhas epic action we can safely get rid of any tanks early on while keeping our battle droids around to be able to exploit later. I also like yellow as a secondary color for him because there’s a few great tricky plays revolving around exploit and NTATOT. Poggle and droid deployment are our MVP starts here, and from there you can either cheat in a super battle droid or tactical droid commander, or if we started with droid deployment we can sac a droid, exploit in the geonosian fighters or the infiltrating demolisher, and bounce their turn one while buffing our remaining B1! So much bonus damage gets pushed out by running both surprise strike AND breaking in at 3 copies each. This is a very fun version and I might even have more fun with this than the double green. Not sure where to start for sideboarding yet, will need more testing!"

I think we need the space ambush in the board to help with what seems like a heavy space future.  Kraken and Choosing sides can play into the token side of things but I am trying to figure out if that is a different deck or if I am just not looking at it right. The rest of the board considerations were various spot removal which should also include Perilous. As for the deck itself you can build big bodies early but Lom Pike might need to go in for shield protection. You are at risk sadly to Jango, Wayland. Ani-value-trade, and I'm sure other viable strategies.  Something to test around with at this point."

After placing them himself, he lets them enter the game directly through the young Padawan Ezra or starts with a bang by using a nice card called \"Now There Are Two,\" where the name says it all. For example, Grogu invites Aunt Rey to join in and surprise the opponent together."

        "comment": "Alright! Now that Big Brother Boba is out of the way; it's time for Beta Fett to shine!!!....hopefully. I played the typical Cunning Ambush deck for a while in set 2 and really enjoyed it; I thought it was pretty powerful for what it was. I was always scared to run the deck list competitively because of the all the Boba Fett's running around and benefiting off of our value trades from our weakened ambush units. Jedha City has synergy with our Enfy's Nest (Yeah... you can bounce a 9 power unit back to hand w/ Boba's leader ability) or our ambush units (if we need them healthy) Red Jango Fett is popular right now but we get immediate value from our ambush units so who cares. All that being said, this deck is still under testing. The goal with this deck is to make value trades with your ambushing units that benefit with Boba's ability. The ideal scenario is we have a low health unit remaining on board that presents a threat as damage to the opponent's base or to the next unit they play. Best case scenario is we do this enough times to where we have more units on board dealing damage to the base while playing reactive ambush units to our opponents answers. Notable changes I made from the previous decklist I ran.\nI removed: EDIT (UPDATE):"

        "comment": "Blooku 4-0 Weekly Recap! Hello Blooku enjoyers! Just won a 9 player weekly event at my LGS in a 4 round event, winning every round! Wanted to break down how each round went, and then note some of the MVP cards of the night, as well as cards that I just never found an opportunity to play or get much value out of. Let me know what you think! Round 1 - W - Leia Red : Round 1 was the classic Leia Red, and this was basically more or less a race to see who would kill who first. Turn 1 Droid Deployment into a Turn 2 exploited Legionnaires bought me enough time to get my gameplan running, and after getting Invisible Hand to hit the board, it was GGs. Damage Taken - 25 Round 2 - W - Anakin Red : Another great opening hand from me allowed me to Turn 1 Patrolling V Wing into Turn 2 Kraken. Anakin didn't activate his ability much in the game to be fair, and I was mainly controlling the board with favorable trades until I had both Hand and Malevolence on the board together. Another smooth game. Damage Taken - 15 Round 3 - W - Wat Red : This was the most intense and fun match of the night. His deck curve was 15 trooper units playable with 1-2 resources, and with when defeat abilities to make the other ones stronger as they died off. With new leaders come some learning curves, and he did miss his leader ability 2 or 3 times, which could have easily swung the game in his favor. He maintained a wide board and rarely traded into my units, favoring base damage instead, which allowed me to exploit out Malevolence to stabilize. Overwhelimg Barrage is still the best card in the game. Damage Taken - 29 Round 4 - W - Jango Tarkintown : Final round started off just straight up annoying, there was constant pinging into my droids, and if he couldn't kill off a unit with pinging he would exhaust it, rendering it useless for that turn. Went out of his way trading out all of my units to prevent me from exploiting, and deployed jango with some upgrades. I flipped and Overwhelming Barraged him away with Dooku, and was finally able to play out my capital ships, swinging the game into my favor, and winning very easily afterwards. Damage Taken - 15 For MVPs of the deck, I am going to share my Top 5 cards of the night, in no particular order! Reprocess was really fun to play, at the low end paying 3 for 3 tokens, and once I ended up with 4, for only 3 resources this card is another great token generator in a pinch! Devastating Gunship was a great turn 2 play to ruin the opponents Turn 1 tempo, or to help finish off an annoying unit that's been trading into you. B2 Legionnaires was amazing for both offense and defense, with a nice healthy 5/4 body with Sentinel AND Overwhelm, helping me get in extra chip damage here and there over smaller units. Lastly, the Invisible Hand and Malevolence. This 1 2 combo is a devastating ender for a game, and even if you can only play out one or the other, both are extremely strong space closers that demand an answer when played! Cards I didn't play much, if at all, or just didn't feel the value of, the main card I'm going to say here is Battle Droid Escort. In my opening hand, I always resourced it, and later in the game I found no purpose. This deck doesn't have much need for 3 drops, if this card was a 2 resource it would be great, just a very awkward card. Count Dooku, I never played, but I never had a reason to also. By that time in the game, I was in a commanding position, and they had no threats that needed an answer from him, as I was in position to win regardless."

Looking at the list, there’s a resemblance to the Rey and Han2 decks that held tier S status for a long time during the second collection. What sets Yoda apart from those lists is the reward for removing enemy units, which lets you filter the top of your deck and hand, as well as the combo with \"You’re My Only Hope\" + 5-cost cards."

        "comment": "Leader Maul is a lot of fun and has really surprised me, I started this deck as just a way to see what I could do with one of my favorite characters Darth Maul. Its natural enemy is aggro but we have a solid amount of sentinel across space and ground with enough space low drops to play to last until mid game when the big boys can come out if they try to avoid our ground units. The overwhelm provided by maul allows you to control the board and chip you opponents base down at the same time while hopefully you also have ramped with a resupply or Superlaser and it is very hard for your opponent to recover. Resupply or Superlaser on resource 3 ramp to 5 for next turn into Darth Maul Legendary forcing you opponent to remove him or threaten the OB then follow with overwhelm action from leader is devastating as you will also flip Leader Maul directly after. I decided to main pillage in the 4 drop slot as I could not find a 4 drop I really liked as also I am almost always ramping from 3 to 5 resources, hitting you opponents hand for 2 cards often feels great for later if you missed ramp. The ground Sentinel units in Phase 3 Trooper, B2 Legionaries, and Pirate Battle Tank were the best sentinel options for helping maintain control of the board state.  Phase 3 trooper often even trades and the B2 is normally played when the opponent is on 4 resources so he is very scary and the battle tank has smuggle so it is a safe resource and is smuggled for 7 instead of 6 normally played a perfect card for this deck. There is also the space line of Kylo's ship, Black Sun Starfighter, Subjugating Starfighter. I tried to find the best variety of options just in case  for worst case scenarios. Side Deck:\nCaught in the crossfire is amazing as removal for this deck and even if something doesn't die the overwhelm from mauls ability will capitalize on low health enemy unit. When not going against aggro force throw is great to side in as after resource 5 we have a lot of force units. Krayt Dragon solid to help finish off a game if needed, with Reinforcement there for if healing might be needed. And 1 Palps return as just in case our opponent gets tricky and we need to bring something back from the discard pile. I am going to make a video explaining my thought process as well on my Youtube channel \"DeerFish Gaming\" for those whom are interested in. Thank you for reading and I hope you had a great day! :)"

        "comment": "Hi guys, I want to share with you my Dooku Exploit Store Tournament Winner (10 people). scoreboard: Captain Rex/Command : 1-2 LOST --> I'm sure that this matchup is pretty winnable; I made an hourrendous missplay in game 3 which made me lose .\nNever forget to resource, especially if u have a turn 7 flip leader :C Anakin Skywalker/Command : 2-0 WIN ---> I absolutely annihilated him.\nThe board presence that you get by the droids and the fact that u can have by turn 2 multiple sentinels ( magna guard cost 1 if exploit a unit, then play lom pyke; easy 2 sentinels setup) made my opponent slow down, allowing me to have my base with a lot of hp left ( unfortunately, on the space arena in the early turns we lack of units choice).\nBy turn 4 (a very important turn where u can play the Count Dooku from set 1 AT 5 Resources thanks to the exploit mechanic of Dooku leader, that will allow to defeat a unit with 4 or less hp, DOPE) game was set for me. Chancellor Palpatine/Vigilance : 2-0 WIN ---> vs Anakin I tried to be in control of the board;  Vs this control version of the Chancellor Palpatine I played extremely fast, ramping a lot (Ty superlaser technician + exploit, easy setup) trying to not get to the higher turns where Snoke and Avenger awaits. That was my experience. Let me know what u think.\nA big downsight of this deck is the limitation of the playbale cards  (These were the only separatist card i think were worth to play. The only change i would bring  is 2x Grievous unit for the magna guard ."

I played the typical Cunning Ambush deck for a while in set 2 and really enjoyed it; I thought it was pretty powerful for what it was. I was always scared to run the deck list competitively because of the all the Boba Fett's running around and benefiting off of our value trades from our weakened ambush units. Jedha City has synergy with our Enfy's Nest (Yeah... you can bounce a 9 power unit back to hand w/ Boba's leader ability) or our ambush units (if we need them healthy) Red Jango Fett is popular right now but we get immediate value from our ambush units so who cares. All that being said, this deck is still under testing. The goal with this deck is to make value trades with your ambushing units that benefit with Boba's ability. The ideal scenario is we have a low health unit remaining on board that presents a threat as damage to the opponent's base or to the next unit they play. Best case scenario is we do this enough times to where we have more units on board dealing damage to the base while playing reactive ambush units to our opponents answers.

        "comment": "Being able to access the clones is a great advantage for blue/green/villainy, giving it a strong early game, while still having OB/Potds/Maul/Snoke and not having to go full tribal. The whole gameplan for the deck is to get to the late game by utilizing the clones in the early game. Being well-statted, they do a good job trading up the curve, being ECL/Timely targets, and in case the opponent does not play units to interact with, they can put some heavy pressure on the opponents base. Depending on the matchup, you either want to trade early or get coordinate online for Hevy, who then becomes a real menace. ECL: If possible, save ECL for the opponents leader flip. In this deck you have ECL targets that are able to one-shot every leader on their flip turn (side in Jesse against Sabine). Steadfast deals with every 7 health leader, Hevy with 6 Health and Wrecker could even one-shot Jabba with 12 health. The ARC kills Asajj and the list goes on… A Malevolence on turn 4 while healing 4 from the exploited Clones can be a real backbreaker for a lot of decks as well. I am considering putting in some Darksabers for the Nala flip, as she then would be an obnoxious 5/10. Let me know of any improvements, I am excited to keep testing this list and tweaking it."

Wat was the leader that grabbed my attention when he was announced. My initial thought was to go Yellow with him, but due to not having the starter deck cards I decided to try Double Green first. Let's go through bullet points on why. This is still an early version of the deck. I've mainly tested against Aggro decks. I need to test against more Control and Space decks. Also, the Sideboard is currently being worked on and should be added soon. It is currently filled with potential Main Deck options. Now let's go through the deck and I'll explain my reasoning for each card I picked."

        "comment": "This deck tries to apply the core concepts of    to   , now that    has been banned.  Similar to    list, the main idea of this deck is to disrupt the opponents opening by pinging an early unit and using    to defeat it. You then do not let him come back into the game again by using cards like   ,    and    while at the same time you put a lot of pressure in the space arena by using powerful cards like   . However, there is a difference of how to approach this with   .  's ability is very powerful since it allows you to perform a \"zero-cost defeat\" in turn 1 by pinging the opponent's unit with a 1-cost card like    or   , then use    to defeat it and then use   's ability to untap the resource you have just used. This allows you to gain a lot of tempo as you still have 2 resources left to either play a powerful 2-cost ship or to play two more 1-cost ground units.   can not do that. You will only have one resource left when defeating an opponent's unit with   /   and   . This means that you can only play one more 1-cost unit, making this opening much weaker compared to   . Especially against pinging leaders such as    or   , this additional 1-cost unit can be easily defeated. On top of that, you would need at least 9 1-cost units in your deck to ensure that you have this opening in your starting hand. This will weaken your mid- and endgame  strategies since it is more likely that you draw those weak 1-cost units at a later stage of the game. This is why this deck is only using 3 ground units in total (3x   ) and is built upon a different opening strategy. The idea is to start with a 2-cost unit in space and delay the   -defeat to turn 2. Now you have the option to use   's ability with tempo by playing either    or    to ping and exhaust the opponent's unit and then to defeat it with   . You want to mulligan for a 2-cost ship and either    or   .   This card is a very universal tool in this deck. It is not only essential for the   -defeat but can also be used at any stage in the game to ping an enemy unit and exhaust it with   's ability. This can be especially strong against enemy leaders. Since    has a defence value of 3 and an attack value of only 1 it is likely to stay longer on the board. This means it can simply attack enemy units to exhaust them with   's ability.  A very universal card for the cost of 1 resource only. It can be used for the   -defeat if you do not have    or    in hand. It can also be used to get rid of some enemy units or as a closer when you target the enemy's base.  Exhausting an enemy unit for two full turns and for 2 resources only is insane. Your main target are leaders, so you are aiming to have this card in hand when the enemy leader deploys. It can also be very good against other strong non-leader units.  Excellent card that can put a lot of pressure to your enemy's base.  Can be weak against some decks but a lot of decks have difficulties with this card.    is also strong against decks that use    or other events that would clear units in the space arena.  Essential card in this deck to initiate the   -defeat with its ping. Can also be played at a later stage of the game in order to ping and exhaust an enemy unit.  The main card in this deck.    lets you deploy    and    for only 4 resources on turn 3. The deployed ship will also come back into your hand at the end of the turn so that you are able to play it again as a closer. If possible, you want to deploy    or    with    and the best turns to do that are turn 4 or turn 5. When played on turn 4 you will be able to put a lot of pressure on the enemy's base early on. If played on turn 5 you are able to play it again on turn 6 as it will come back into your hand. In some situations you can be forced to play    on turn 3 which is fine, especially if you have multiple copies in your hand.  Great ship that is ready once you deploy it thanks to   .  Can be an excellent closer and is one of the main targets for   .    is a great ship by its own since it has 4 attack and 6 defence making it no valid target for    and   .  However, it is insanely strong in this deck since its ability will trigger   . This means that once it is deployed you can deal 2 damage to a unit AND exhaust it.  This makes you gain a lot of tempo since your opponent is losing it.    is also excellent if combined with   . For 5 resources it comes into play ready and its ability will be triggered twice. It deals a total of 8 damage to the enemy's base plus 2 times 2 damage to ground units where at least one of those will trigger   .   and   Those are the only available 2-cost ships that come with the 3/2 stat line. This is especially what we want in turn 1 in order to bring early pressure on the board and still having 2 defence to survive ping damage.  Very flexible ship that can either be played on turn 1 or later on to exhaust an enemy unit. Its defence value of 3 is great since it not only withstands ping damage but also withstands some attacks as well as some events like   .  Great ship that can be very difficult to handle for some decks. Especially strong agains events like   .  For the cost of 3 resources this ship comes with a great stat line of 3/4. Its ability is also usable and strong against some matchups, making it a great 3-cost ship.  Great tool to get rid of annoying units. This card is also very effective against high cost enemy units and units that have been played using the    ability. When your opponent plays a unit for 5 or 6 resources or sacrificed units in order to play it and you send it back to his/her hand for only 3 resources, that is always a great deal for you.  This card can put a lot of pressure on your opponents base, especially when used with   . It can also be effective when used with     since its ability will also trigger twice.   Can be a strong unit in this deck since it can capture an enemy unit to disrupt the enemy's game plan while at the same time it gains us tempo by deploying another space unit. The    restriction could be an issue sometimes.  Great ability for this deck by putting 2 damage on the enemy's base. However, since the ability only triggers if there is another    unit under your control it can be quite tricky. The only    unit that will be for sure in this deck is    and this unit usually does not stay in play that long since it only has 2 defence. Another    unit is    but its not so sure if it will be in the final deck.  Since this deck has almost no ground presence, it can be good to have access to this card in case the ground arena becomes too threatening.  Very interesting card that can lead to very interesting plays, especially with    and   . The problem is that you do not know how your opponent will decide. Maybe too big of a gamble.  Even without   , this card can be strong in this deck since it is a potential target for   . If you are able to exploit an    that you do not need anymore or another damaged unit that is about to be defeated, it is even playable for the cost of 3 resources only. On top of that, its ability can trigger   .  Even without   , this card could be strong if you exploit an    that you do not need anymore to bounce an enemy's unit. It could also harmonise with    to get rid of an enemy unit."

        "comment": "Hello, everyone!    here. Creator of the    deck that became very popular at the end of the second set. I decided to create a new list with Tarkintown that is as strong as Boba Fett Tarkintown, but this time, on the heroic side of the force. First of all, why   ? The answer is quite simple. Quinlan + Tarkintown is absurdly consistent. It is guaranteed to destroy your opponent's early game 99% of the time. The goal of this deck is to disrupt your opponent's early game and then put so much value and pressure on the board that your opponent will not be able to get back into the game. This deck is almost a mix between Boba1 Tarkintown, Sabine Yellow and Cad Bane. The unit base is mostly focused on Space, using only ground units that have some very relevant effect.    to tap the opponent's units (especially the leaders) and avoid high-value plays, but it can also be a turn 1 play. Your opponent starts with a 2-cost card, you play Leia, deal 1 damage to his unit with Quinlan, untap a resource with Leia, destroy the opponent's turn 1 with Tarkintown, play a 1-cost ship with the resource you untapped with Leia  , which is a very important unit at any point in the game. Early in the game, he can try to find a Millenium Falcon to fit in on turn 2 (which is the best possible unit to play on the second turn), and in the mid/late game, he can try to find For A Cause I Believe or any other card that might be useful at the time you are in.  , is usually the card you will always recurse and later in the game, play him as a unit to deal surprise damage after your opponent takes the initiative.  , no comments needed.  , simply kills Boba Fett with one attack, on the deploy turn. 6 damage from Plo Koon + 1 damage from Quinlan. This card is extremely absurd.  Simply the best ships in the game.   , 3 specifically. The deck floods the board very easily, so in the mid game, starting to dump Heroic Sacrifice on 1-cost units, like Wolf Pack Escort, can help you close the game very quickly. Also classic combo with K-2SO.  , 3 damage. Strong.  , best heroic event in the game.  Very relative, it all depends on how the meta will be, but for now, I kept cards that are excellent   to deal with sentinels   to target Barrage on Quinlan's deploy turn or one turn before, if the opponent has ramped  , an excellent ship, destroys upgrades, good against Sabers, Bounty healing and Boba's Armor  , another tool to deal with Barrage/Cunning  , a single copy to help in matchups against aggro  If you want to also contact me on Discord:  "

        "comment": "This is the list I took to win the Melbourne PQ in Australia. It's Linque's Boba1 Tarkintown list with a couple Sneak Attacks for some personal flavour. Going into the PQ I was expecting lots of Sabine, Boba1, and Rey Tarkintown from my knowledge of the local meta. I was also expecting some Bossk ECL, Qi'ra ECL, Kylo, and only a little hard control. Before going into the breakdown I wanted to thank Linque for creating the original list, the others in the Discord chat who helped me better understand the list and sideboard, and my local friends who helped me test the list and supported me on the day. SB: -2 TIE Advanced -1 Lurking TIE Phantom +3 Outmaneuver This matchup is favourable to us, but it's still not easy. I find it harder than the Sabine ECL matchup because they have 5 more health on their base and more unexpected explosiveness like Surprise Strike and Millennium Falcon. The reason for taking out the TIE Advanced is that they're simply not great into decks that have Waylay, and removing a Lurking TIE Phantom because they're squishy and Sabine Yellow decks run Millennium Falcon. You always want to add in Outmaneuver against aggro decks, shutting them down for a turn gains you lots of tempo and wins games. SB: -3 Lurking TIE Phantom +3 Outmaneuver A simple matchup and one I've practiced a hundred times over. You remove the Lurking TIE Phantoms because they're too squishy, especially with the opponent being able to ECL into it and their unit still lives. Outmaneuver added again because aggro. One key thing to watch out for against Sabine ECL is their Bright Hope, so you either need to hold up Tarkintown, Surprise Strike, or even a Triple Dark Raid for the Ruthless Raider if you're feeling risky. SB: -3 Mercenary Gunship +3 Wolffe This is another favourable matchup for us, you just have to be cautious regarding their Rey and Luke. If they get enough restore on the board they'll start healing more than you can output and take the game. Holding a Wolffe and NGTMD are great ways to put a damper on this and get that extra 1-2 turns you need to close out the game. SB: -3 Lurking TIE Phantom +3 Outmaneuver Another Sabine ECL, pretty standard matchup. Pop T1 play, a get lead on the aggro, use NGTMD, Waylay, and Outmaneuver to keep them at bay while beating down in the space arena. I am a little annoyed that in both of these games I didn't get a 2 drop ship in my mulligan but oh well, such is life. Have to play these games. SB: -3 Lurking TIE Phantom -2 TIE Advanced +3 Outmaneuver +2 Look The Other Way This is our hardest matchup, with Cunning, Bodhi, and Cantina Bouncer they can disrupt your turns and get ahead on tempo and damage. However, luckily my opponent had never played against a Boba1 Tarkintown deck before and didn't know what was coming. In the end I had the upper hand in knowing the matchup. Afterwards I walked him through my deck and showed him some of my combos, how he needs to play into it, etc. which almost bit me in the ass in the top cut. SB: -3 Mercenary Gunship +3 Wolffe This is also a pretty good matchup for us. Holding up the Tarkintown makes them nervous and hesitant to use their Han2 ability which already puts them behind the curve for their deck. You just need to hold up Force Choke for their Yoda or Kaanan and NGTMD for their Luke to shut down their healing and smash them in base. The only space unit to be worried about is Concord, so hold up Tarkintown or Surprise Strike for that. SB: -2 TIE Advanced +2 Change of Heart At this point both my opponent and I were undefeated and guaranteed top cut, so we were just chilling and having fun. Although it's not a great matchup for us, it's definitely beatable, however my opponent is part of my local testing group so he was very familiar with my deck already which made it 50/50 at best. Again take out TIE Advanced because Waylay, and add in Change of Heart because Boba1 green has a few big units like Maul, Vader, and I knew my opponent was running Xanadu Blood and Devastator too. If you can ping off their small units, let them play Maul, then take it the turn after, it wins games. SB: -3 Mercenary Gunship +3 Wolffe I was feeling confident into this, especially because I saw on their decklist and they weren't running Pillage. This means I didn't have to hold up excessive amounts of cards to work around it (but still think about Force Throw). In the end it just came down to me having NGTMD for Luke and a well timed Wolffe. SB: -2 TIE Advanced -1 Lurking TIE Phantom +3 Outmaneuver This game was against the same player as round 5 of swiss. I'd already beaten him with the element of surprise, but now he knows the matchup better. This time I sideboarded differently, I opted out of siding in Look The Other Way and left some Lurking TIE Phantoms in the main board. The reason is because I had a little more experience playing against him, saw his list, and realised he's playing a more defensive and controlling deck, different to the aggro Boba Yellow decks I've versed in the past. So to get the upper hand on the aggro I wanted to leave a couple Lurking TIE Phantoms in. He managed to take one game which he credited to the help I gave him after round 5 of swiss, glad I was able to help him better understand my deck. SB: -3 Lurking TIE Phantom +3 Outmaneuver Going into the final round was the first time this entire PQ I felt I actually had a chance of winning it. I dodged the Boba1 decks early, managed to fight through the ones I did get paired against, and now my last round was a good matchup for me. Of course sideboard is throwing in Outmaneuver, and funnily enough my opponent didn't have a sideboard, but he's a very strong player with an extremely sturdy list. I did notice no Bright Hope, which for me means I can ram them down on space and they can't top deck something that will stop me. First game I just blew them out of the water. Ping + TT, Waylay, NGTMD, I had all the answers. Second game was very close, I was one action or a Surprise Strike away from the win. They managed to get a Poe and Wrecker on field and I couldn't keep the damage off. Third game was extremely close. I got the Seventh Fleet Defender + TIE Advanced off, and from there it was just hold them down with Outmaneuver and a well timed Cartel Spacer to put the damage in. I managed to win the final game on deployment turn. I was concerned running this deck into a meta with a lot of Boba1 decks because it can be a tough matchup, but I managed to dodge them early and had a good run into the ones I did verse. I don't think there's anything I'd change about this list, it's very well tuned and ran like clockwork. Even when you don't get the draws you want there are still ways to put insane amounts of damage on base. I don't believe this is the best deck in the meta, but it's still extremely strong. I won this through my advantage of my opponents' inexperience in the matchup and the many hours of research and testing I did, which is more important than just playing what's best. Overall it was a fun day. 12 hours of SWU and I somehow managed to take the win. I just wanted to give a final shoutout to Linque who built the original list and really helped me understand the deck and sideboard better, my friends online and in person who have helped me test and refine the list, as well as support me through the PQ. And of course the LGS's I attend regularly to play. If anyone wants a full write up on individual card choices and how the sideboard works, I'd be happy to do one, however Linque is the original creator of the list and has far more games, a much deeper understanding, and can provide a more in-depth analysis of the deck as a whole."
